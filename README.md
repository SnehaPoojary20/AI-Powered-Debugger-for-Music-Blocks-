This is a basic prototype demonstrating an AI-powered debugging system for Music Blocks. It identifies common errors and suggests corrections based on predefined rules. 
However, this is only a proof of concept; the final implementation will have a completely different UI, fully integrated with Music Blocks for a seamless user experience
Prototype Features:
ðŸ”¹ Accepts a sample Music Blocks program as input.
ðŸ”¹ Identifies common errors (e.g., missing connections, infinite loops).
ðŸ”¹ Suggests corrections based on predefined rules or a simple AI model.
